# JS.SimpleCounter
A JS counter app you can count on... literally.

This is a simple counter web application created as part of my personal practice with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Specially in the areas of:
- DOM manipulation in JavaScript
- Event handling with addEventListener
- Responsive UI styling using CSS
- Semantic HTML structure

There are three features:
- Add (+1) to the counter
- Subtract (-1) from the counter
- Clear the counter (reset to 0)
